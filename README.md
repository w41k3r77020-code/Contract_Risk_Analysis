📄 Contract Risk Analysis (ML + NLP)

An AI powered system that analyzes legal contracts and predicts their risk level.
The model evaluates a newly uploaded contract and determines whether it is fake, suspicious, or safe, along with a risk percentage score.

This helps users quickly identify problematic agreements and reduces manual legal review effort.
